# Kestra Quickbooks Plugin

## What

- Provides plugin components under `io.kestra.plugin.quickbooks`.
- Includes the base class `AbstractQuickBooksConnection`.

## Why

- What user problem does this solve? Teams need a concrete starting point for building and validating new Kestra plugins without recreating the same project scaffolding from scratch.
- Why would a team adopt this plugin in a workflow? It gives plugin authors a ready-made reference repo they can adapt alongside their own build, test, and publishing workflow.
- What operational/business outcome does it enable? It shortens plugin delivery time, reduces setup mistakes, and makes internal or partner plugin development more repeatable.
